The package in the folder is Modelica code and can be run using any Modelica-compliant tool.
In particular, it can be run successfully using the free Modelica editing and simulation tool OpenModelica (www.openmodelica.org) 

The first thing you  can do is to re-run the models inside the internal folder "PaperModels". Running them, you  will be able to reproduce the figures of the companion paper.
To have a hint on what to look at first, consult the "information" box of the full package and of the model inside the PaperModels folder you will want to simulate.

Then you can make any re-simulation you want, changing models parameters, and/or  structure. 
Before  publishing results using these models, or models derived from them, consult LICENSE.TXT.
