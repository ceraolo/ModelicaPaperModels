The code in this folder is associated with the following paper:
"Grid forming inverters for electric vehicle charging stations to enhance distribution grid resilience"
submitted for publication on IEEE Access

It is intended for the use of the readers of this paper. It can be re-run, as is or with changes, and the results of these simulations freely used.
Any use of the code different from running it in a Modelica tool, e.g. inclusion in other modelica models, or reproduction of it or parts of it in published material (papers, leaflets, etc), must carry quotation of the above-mentioned paper. 

An example of such quotation is as follows (actual paper data will take the place of hashtags, when and if the paper is accepted).

This piece of code was drawn form the code made available on a gitHub archive from the authors of the paper
